# Sparti: Bayesian Nonparametric Space Partition methods
A toolbox of Bayesian nonparametric space partition methods. We provide implementations of Sparti methods as follows:

- [Rectangular Bounding Process](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/hash/8ce87bdda85cd44f14de9afb86491884-Abstract.html) Xuhui Fan, Bin Li, Scott A. Sisson. The 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS-18) 
    
    This method uses "bounding" strategy to directly generate boxes in a product space and is able to reduce modelling on sparse and noisy regions.
    
- [Binary Space Partitioning-Tree Process](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v84/fan18b.html) Xuhui Fan, Bin Li, Scott A. Sisson. The 21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS- 18). 
    
    This method allows sloped hierarchical cuts in a 2-dimensional space and can describe dimensional dependencies.

- [Binary Space Partitioning Forest](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/fan19b.html) Xuhui Fan, Bin Li, Scott A. Sisson. The 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS- 19). 
    
    This method uses 2-dimensional hyperplane to enable sloped cuts in a multi-dimensional space. 

- [Online Binary Space Partitioning Forests](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/fan20a) Xuhui Fan, Bin Li, Scott A. Sisson. The 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS-20). 
    
    This method adopts the generative process of Binary Space Partitioning Forests to enable online learning.
